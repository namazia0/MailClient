# MailClient

A mail client with a graphical user interface that enables you to log in, read, write, delete, save, and send Gmail messages.

This project was developed as part of our Software Development Bachelor's project at university by a team of four students. 
Over the course of four weeks, we built the application using Java, Gradle, JSON, XML, and TCP/IP.
